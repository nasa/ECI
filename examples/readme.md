# Overview

This directory contains source code for several ECI-based apps. This source code must be compiled in a CFS build tree with the ECI source code. For additional information on how to do that, either refer to the [CI pipeline](../ci/) for this repo or the [Integration Guide] (../doc/ECI_FSW_Integration_Guide.docx) included in the docs.
